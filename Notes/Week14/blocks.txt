Basic blocks and flow graphs
======================================================================

Essentially: we will preprocess the IR code to help with "optimizations"


Basic block:
    a maximal sequence of consecutive (3-address) instructions such that:

        (1) Flow of control can only enter the beginning of the block.
              (no jumps to the middle)

        (2) No gotos, return, halt allowed inside the block except as
            the last instruction.


    This means: we will either execute ALL of the basic block, or NONE.


Flow graphs:
    graphs with
        * Nodes are basic blocks
        * edges between blocks B1 and B2  (B1 -> B2)
          block B2 can be executed after B1
              either B2 follows B1 and B1 doesn't end with an uncond. goto
              or the end of B1 is a goto to B2



Next time:
  how to determine the basic blocks.
  and some examples.
