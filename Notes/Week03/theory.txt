Some theory:

* There are tools to build lexers.
  -> specify patterns for each token
  -> tool generates a recognizer flowchart for each token
  -> then combined into one huge flowchart
  -> from the flowchart, generate a state machine table
  -> scanner runs using the table(s)


Rest of lectures
  -> how to specify patterns
  -> how to build the flowcharts from the patterns
  -> how to combine flowcharts
  -> how to generate tables
  -> A bit on flex/lex which is a "standard" tool.
